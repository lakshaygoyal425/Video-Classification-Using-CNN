# Video-Classification-CNN
To classify videos into various classes using keras library with tensorflow as back-end.

I have taken 4 classes from The Sports Classification Dataset like Boxing, Football, Pushups, and Squats. First we have Split video into frames and resize them into 224x224 dimensions. I gave the labels to those images and trained them on VGG16 pretrained model. 

I achieved 98.87% training accuracy and 99.46% testing accuracy using CNN model.
